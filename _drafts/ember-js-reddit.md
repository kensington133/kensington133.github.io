This project utilises the [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) web application frame work, this time around I decided to use the [reddit jsonp api](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/JSON) to make a start on a responsive reddit web page.

So far I have got the data from the [front page of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) this includes who posted it, at what time how many up and down votes it has, how many comments it has and lots more. I am then displaying it on the index route of the application.

In the future I would like to:
- retrieve a posts comments (partially working)
- view other sub reddits e.g. [/r/aww](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/)
- log in with existing reddit account
- vote on submissions
