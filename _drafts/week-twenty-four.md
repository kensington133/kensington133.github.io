This week I was given a few more amendments to the Gecko Head Gear [quote system](http://geckoheadgear.com/contact/quote) this included removing some helmet styles that are being redesigned and are going to be relaunched at a later date. I left them disabled in the selection box so if customers wonder where they are they can see that they aren't currently available

Also I finished the brendon arms [mobile website](http://brendonarms.co.uk) this week, I added a few more pages to the website and checked over all the SEO on the website.
WAT
Finally I also started to create a [mobile website](http://m.thelookoutincornwall.co.uk/FOUNDATION-MOBILESITE-BACKUP/) for The Look Out, a holiday cottage in north cornwall. To start off with instead of using a mobile template by MD, I have decided to use [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) a responsive framework which comes with a lot of features and easy to use grid system for scaling pages accordingly.

I feel this will be a great learning opportunity because it allows me to create a more feature rich website with booking forms and slideshows instead of my simpler [portfolio website](http://heybenshort.co.uk).

To start off with I downloaded the frame work and started creating a basic structure, working of the [desktop website](http://thelookoutincornwall.co.uk/) style. So far I have managed to complete the basic template for each page following the desktop website style and started creating pages using the content in the desktop website.
