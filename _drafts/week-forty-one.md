This week was entirely spent on first checking all of MD's 80+ websites by going through every pages clicking on every link, checking for missing images and checking if contact forms send emails correctly.

Also this week we uploaded MD's admin system to every client, setting up the databases on each website, making sure it connected and testing it to make sure it worked correctly and the clients all had the correct features enabled.

A few websites couldn't be properly tested as their DNS records had not properly propagated throughout the internet but we still uploaded the files to make sure when it does change over that the websites will show and we will test these next week.
