At the beginning of this week unfortunately our servers operating system become corrupt and crashed and become unresponsive. This meant all of the clients websites and emails were no longer accessible. This lead to a crazy week of dealing with clients while sorting through backups to see what we had and hadn't lost.

Fortunately we have a second server for some more server demanding clients so we got our hosting company to move our backup drive into our second server. This allowed for us to download and look at all the backups we had. Also on the second server we set up all the emails to be sent off the second server as this was the top priority before the websites. The decision was made to get a new server as even with just the emails on the second server it was under a lot of strain so setting up all our websites on the server wasn't a viable option.

After setting up all the emails we then had to wait for the server to be built by the hosting company which took two days, when this was done we started to upload all the websites we could without any content management system, just to get them back up and running.

Next week we shall focus on getting websites live with an admin system and testing them thoroughly.
