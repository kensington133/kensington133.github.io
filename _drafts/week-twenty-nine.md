olive tree gallery



The olive tree also has a mobile website, so this week I modified the responsive gallery I created on the Look Out mobile [snapshots page](http://m.thelookoutincornwall.co.uk/south.west.photo.gallery). For this I had to only change the colours of the overlay to match the site style and it was ready to go.
