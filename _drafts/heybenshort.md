After using [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [wordpress](http://en-gb.wordpress.org/) to create my portfolio website previously I thought it was time for a change, and that change was [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

However before any form of programming started I thought it would be best to actually plan and design my website, instead of jumping straight in like I have done previously.

With this I mind I opened up PhotoShop and started creating ideas. I eventually came up with this design which you are seeing right now, I wanted it to use more colours than my old website as I feel my old website was black, dull and uninteresting. To choose the perfect colours I used Adobe's [Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/), This allowed me to pick colours that worked together and suited each other.

The various stages of design and re-design can be seen in the gallery at the bottom of the page.

I chose to replace my blogging platform from wordpress to Jekyll as Jekyll doesn't rely on databases to store posts. It uses flat files such as markdown(.md), textile or HTML. This means that the website is much easier to manage as all I have to do to create another post is start writing in a text editor and away I go!

I also chose Jekyll because of its ability to include files using the syntax `{% include file.html %}`, this allowed me to create various files that I could include such as a header, footer and other common elements.


Jekyll uses yaml files for storing data, I took advantage of this when creating my gallery pages by creating a [galleries.yml]()
