This week I continued my work on the postage system and got all of the parts of the class working together to store, delete and update all of the postage types, assigned postage types and weight types.

This was a good refresher on object oriented PHP with private and public methods and getters and setters.

Along with creating the PHP class I needed to create an interface for users to input their data in the admin system, this included creating forms to send data to the database and tables retrieving data from the database.

Postage Interface with Standard Form:

Postage Interface with Weight Form:

Product Assign Postage Interface:

Now that it's complete I will create a demo catalogue website next week in order to test my new postage class properly.
