This week I was working on Gecko Headgear as they wanted to make some changes to their [quote system](http://www.geckoheadgear.com/contact/quote).

They wanted to be able to buy Visors along with their tints in the optional extras section as people want to be able to buy more than one type of visor style or tint with their helmet purchase. Also Gecko wanted to be able to just buy optional extras separately from helmets.

As I hadn't work on this in a while I first refreshed my memory on how the system works in the first place and what I would need to do in order to get the desired outcome.

In the end I came up with the idea that there should be a separate drop down just for additional visors as once you  have chosen your visor type, you then have to choose a visor tint, something that the optional extras section doesn't handle.

This Quote from has taught me lots about JavaScript and jQuery and has greatly increased my knowledge and skills in both.
