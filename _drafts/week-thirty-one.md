This week I updated some advertising gifs for [schoolcomms](http://schoolcomms.com/) a systems aiding the communication between home and school, I followed the specification in the style guide for schoolcomms and editing the gifs according to the clients needs. This including changing text, content and the various layers for the gif animation.

Also this week I added the [Nomada page](http://www.thebeachatbude.co.uk/tapas.bar.bude) to the beach at bude website. This included following a PhotoShop file with the page design in and adding in the images for the full screen background slideshow. I had a few difficulties in getting the image of Nomada logo to fit like it showed in the design, so I had to modify a few setting the sites JavaScript in order for it to display properly.

Finally, this week I continued to work on my website redesign, for more information see my production [blog post]({{site.url}}posts/heybenshort/).
