As things had started to quieten off I decided to redesign my website to make it more colourful.
Instead of jumping straight in I decided to use PhotoShop to plan and layout my design in order to create a template in which to follow when coding the website.

For this website I decided to ditch wordpress and foundation in favour for [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). This allowed me to create a flat, static website using templates which generated HTML files. This will reduce the load time of pages due to no queries to a database to get posts, images, etc.

For more information including images of the design process and a more detailed description of how things were done see my [blog post](http://localhost:4000/posts/heybenshort/).
