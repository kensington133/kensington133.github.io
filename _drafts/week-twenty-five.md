This week was spent purely on the look out [mobile website](http://m.thelookoutincornwall.co.uk/FOUNDATION-MOBILESITE-BACKUP/).

I have added more pages in using the content from the [desktop website](http://thelookoutincornwall.co.uk/), I have used various parts of foundation to add interactive elements to each page. For example the slideshows and testimonial sliders on the [homepage](http://m.thelookoutincornwall.co.uk/FOUNDATION-MOBILESITE-BACKUP/) were creating using the [orbit](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/orbit.html) image slider.

I also integrated MD Websolutions holdiday let calendar into a foundation [reveal modal](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/reveal.html) which can be seen [here](http://m.thelookoutincornwall.co.uk/FOUNDATION-MOBILESITE-BACKUP/countryside.accommodation.bude) (click on the availability button under the image). I chose to use a reveal modal as it looks similar to the desktop website but works on all mobile devices, this allows for more users to be able to book a stay at either of the holiday cottages.
