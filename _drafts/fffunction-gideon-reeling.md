As part of some freelance work, I along with a friend worked on resolving issues with the website [gideonreeling.co.uk](http://www.gideonreeling.co.uk/) for [fffunction](http://fffunction.co/) a well respected web development company based in cornwall.

The issues that we had to fix varied from styling bugs to installing WordPress plug-ins. The website uses SCSS a CSS style language that gets compiled into raw CSS, I had never used it before on such a large scale so the learning curve was large but ultimately it increased my SCSS skills to no end.

I'd like to thank Adam Robertson ([@robeam)](https://twitter.com/robeam) for this opportunity and I look forward to working with fffunction in the future.
