<p>I started off the week by completing the fix on the portfolio links image uploader MD Web solutions admin system. I added some more form validation with jQuery and tested it thoroughly.</p>
<p>This week I started to create a website for <a title="BudeZest Construction in Bude, Cornwall" href="http://budezest.co.uk/" target="_blank">BudeZest</a>, a construction company based in Bude, Cornwall. I was given a photoshop file from the designer and began to think out how about going to create the website as it including some tricky images such as pencils and rubbers that had to be placed separate from the the main content of the site in order to be positioned correctly on any screen size.</p>
<p>I continued to work on this website for the rest of the week were I came upon a few challenges, first of which was creating image for the header, background and footer. This was a challenge because I needed to align them all correctly and make sure the content background repeated and repeated neatly. The second challenge I came across was positioning the logo so that it was over the content. To do this I had to create a separate image for the logo and position it in the header and make sure all the shadows didn't overlap. In the end I went through over 10 revisions of the header and logo image in order to get it correct.</p>
