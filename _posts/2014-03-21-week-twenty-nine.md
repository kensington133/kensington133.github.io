This week I added the final touches to the mobile site, this included changing how the images were display on the holiday property pages so that the images are in a slideshow at the top of the page instead of down the side.

Also this week the I was working on the olive tree mobile website, so this week I modified the responsive gallery I created on the Look Out mobile [snapshots page](http://m.thelookoutincornwall.co.uk/south.west.photo.gallery). For this I had to only change the colours of the overlay to match the site style and it was ready to go.
