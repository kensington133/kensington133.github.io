I started off the weekÂ doing some minor updates to the Beach at Bude website, I was given a photoshop file and then changed the prices page to be in a table to match the photoshop file.

Then for the rest of the week I was creating an interactive slideshow for Elements Hotel in Widemouth Bay using JavaScript and jQuery.

I created roughly about 70% of the slideshow then became stuck and asked for help and ended up finishing it off with extra help.

The next day it was suggested that I should write the slideshow again from scratch in order to make sure I had learnt how to do it properly. although this was frustrating at first by the end of the week when I had completed the slideshow I had learnt a lot more and reinforced my jQuery and javascript knowledge than if I just used the version that I created at the start of the week

It will be put live next week and a link to it will be featured at the top of every page in the website
