<p>At the start of this week I was adding the newer, faster version of the holiday let calendar to the <a title="Waldon Valley Lodges - Holiday calendar page" href="http://www.waldon-valley-lodges.co.uk/waldon.valley.lodges.booking" target="_blank">Waldon Valley Lodges website</a>. This involved using HTML, PHP and JavaScript, I started off by looking at the calendar on the <a title="Olive Tree - Holiday Accommodation booking page" href="http://www.olivetreebude.co.uk/holiday.accommodation.bude.cornwall" target="_blank">Olive Tree website</a> and borrowing bits of code I have previously used so that the new calendar implementation can be added as smoothly and as quickly as possible. The Calendar uses AJAX a method in JavaScript that can load other scripts onto the page. In this instance it obatains the relevant calendar information such as how many days are in the month(s), and when arrival dates are etc... This allows for a vast improvement in speed as the amount of code being run to generate the calendar has been decreased substantially.</p>
<p>My next task during this week was to put the Olive Tree holiday accommodation calendar live, this involved moving the right pages from the development area of the website to the live section of the website. This simple transition didn't go as smoothly as i had hoped but in the end I got it live without too much disruption the the website.</p>
<p>Finally, for the rest of the week I started to create a website crawler for MD, this would crawl through all the clients websites using PHP to check for various things such as the page cannot be displayed information is correct, a sitemap exists and is correct,  a cookie policy exists and google analytics is installed. I have yet to finish this task but it is a interesting task and challenge which will hopefully teach me some new techniques.</p>
<p>This week I have learned that when putting a site or parts of a site live I need to check thoroughly all parts of the website to ensure that it is working properly before confirming that it is working.</p>
