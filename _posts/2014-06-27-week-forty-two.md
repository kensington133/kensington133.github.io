This week was the last week of my placement as MD Web Solutions is closing down today.

This week I have been helping finish things up and doing a few last minute updates for clients.

I would like to thank MD for having me and I feel that my knowledge has increased greatly and I now have a large chunk of experience to help my prospects in finding a job in the future.
