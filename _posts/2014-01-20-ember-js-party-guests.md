title: Ember.js - Party Guests MVC

This project utilises the [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) web application frame work, as this was my first attempt at ember.js I had previously followed [this tutorial](http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/) and I decided I could adapt this into something else to improve my knowledge of ember before creating sometime from scratch.

In the end I ended up with a [guest organiser]({{site.url}}projects/ember-js/party-guests/), an adaptation of the [todo example](http://{{site.url}}projects/ember-js/todo/) I had done previously.
