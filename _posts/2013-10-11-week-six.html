<p>This week was primarily spent adding in more content and search engine optimisation to Shorelines website.</p>
<p>I was given various emails from the client and had to figure out which pages it belonged to and if they didn't exist to create them.</p>
<p>Also i was inserting images and creating imaginative and descriptive descriptions for each of the images in order the search engine optimisation.</p>
<p>I also started to create some interactive forms to send payments for shoreline activities and events to paypal.</p>
