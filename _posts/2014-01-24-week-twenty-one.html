<p>This week I continued to work on the the Gecko Headgear quote form, this week I was able to get the pricing section of the page working, this involved a lot of JavaScript and jQuery in order to obtain the right prices and updating the prices or text in the prices section when a different item was chosen from the drop down selections.</p>
<p>I also learnt about <code>parseFloat()</code> and <code>parseInt()</code> when dealing with the prices and also how concatenation is different compared to PHP. In Javascript it is <code>+=</code> whereas in PHP it is <code>.=</code></p>
