This week I have been continuing to focus on getting shorelines content and SEO in and completed.
as well as this I have been given small text updates for various other websites

I have also started to create a website for BudeZest, a construction company from bude.

I was given a photoshop file with the site design and was tasked with creating it from scratch. I had to set up the FTP details and create the pages ready for the design to be created.

I first began by creating the graphics for the header, footer and the logo. I had trouble aligning the header and logo together in order for the header and logo to be separate so it allows for the logo to overlap the content of the website. I went through 12 iterations of the logo and header before I got it right
