<p>This website was a simple on page website but with some interactive content also.</p>
<p>To create this website I was given a photoshop file with the website design on and left to my own devices. This allowed me to create the testimonial slider and gallery from scratch using jQuery.</p>
<p>Upon completing this website I have strengthened my jQuery skills and more confident in creating galleries and sliders.</p>
<p>This project was undertaken as part of my employment with <a title="MD Websolutions in Bude, Cornwall" href="http://md-websolutions.co.uk" target="_blank">MD Web Solutions</a>. All images and project information published with permission from MD Web Solutions.</p>
