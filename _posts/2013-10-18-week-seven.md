This week I finished off one of shoreline's [interactive payment form](http://www.shorelineactivities.co.uk/shoreline.activity.payments "Shoreline Extreme Sports interactive payments form") for extreme sports activites.

This form uses PHP to process the data and sends it to a special paypal page. jQuery was used to validate the form to make sure erroneous input was avoided.

My next task was to fix a bug in the MD Web solutions client admin system. The bug was that any users on a mac computer weren't able to use the custom image uploader fort the portfolio links part of the admin system. To fix this I adapted a form from another part of the admin system in order to allow ful cross browser and operating system compatibility.

Finally my final task of the week was to edit an image using photoshop to create a gradient around the main background image for [Alchemist Jewellery](http://www.alchemist-jewellery.com/ "Alchemist Jewellery in Bude, Cornwall"). To do this was a method of trial and error in order for the image to look just right.
