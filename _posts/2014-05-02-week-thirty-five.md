This week I continued on with my work on the postage system for MD Web Solutions admin system.

First off I had to plan out the database tables and how they will relate to each other, I did this by sketching them out on paper, first was how many tables should I use, then it was what fields should go into these tables and how do they relate to each other.

After scribbling notes on some paper I came up with these three tables:
![Postage Types Table]({{ site.url }}/assets/blog/tblpostagetypes.png)
![Postage Weight Units Table]({{ site.url }}/assets/blog/tblpostageunits.png)
![Product Postage Table]({{ site.url }}/assets/blog/tblproductpostage.png)
