This week consisted of purely working on the [tariffs page](http://www.thelookoutincornwall.co.uk/countryside.accommodation.tariffs "The Look Out - Holiday accommodation tariffs") on the look out holiday cottages website.

The website had to go live at the end of the week so it was crucial I got all the tariffs displaying correctly.

Although it took me right up until Friday afternoon to complete, I did, in the end, manage to get it working. Looking back at it now, it seems baffling why it took me a week to figure out how to check between tariffs, but I suppose that is all part of the learning curve.

This week I have learnt:

- Even wheat seem simple tasks may take the longer than first expected
- Using `date` and `strtotime` functions in PHP to alter date formats and increasing and decreasing days correctly
