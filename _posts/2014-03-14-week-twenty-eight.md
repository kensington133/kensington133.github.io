This week I was given some updates to do on the Olive Tree [gallery page](http://olivetreebude.co.uk/gallery) which I had done last week.

Instead of having three different categories, the client wanted the page to just show the food pictures, so I went about chopping and changing the gallery that was already in place. However after a few attempts at changing the old code and multiple bugs I decided to just adapt the gallery I had done previously on the Elements [gallery page](http://www.elements-life.co.uk/elements-hotel-gallery). This involved changing the colour of the loading spinner gif and the navigational arrows, also I had to change the widths of the image selector a the bottom to better accommodate the slightly older layout of the Olive Tree.

Also this week I continued to add content and create pages for the Brendon [mobile website](http://www.brendonarms.co.uk/).
