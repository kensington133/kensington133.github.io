This website was a simple on page website but with some interactive content also.

To create this website I was given a photoshop file with the website design on and left to my own devices. This allowed me to create the testimonial slider and gallery from scratch using jQuery.

Upon completing this website I have strengthened my jQuery skills and more confident in creating galleries and sliders.

This project was undertaken as part of my employment with [MD Web Solutions](http://md-websolutions.co.uk "MD Websolutions in Bude, Cornwall"). All images and project information published with permission from MD Web Solutions.
