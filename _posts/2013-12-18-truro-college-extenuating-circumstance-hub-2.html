<p>For my final year project whilst as Truro College we were given the task of creating an electronic version of the extenuating circumstance system. Before this system was create all claims had to be submitted on paper and this required a lot of storage space to keep records of all the claims. Also the forms could be misplaced, incomplete forms were submitted and there was a long turn around time for each form.</p>
<p>The <a title="Extenuating Circumstance Hub - Truro College" href="https://extcirc.truro-penwith.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Extenuating Circumstance Hub</a>Â allows for easy creation, submitting and processing of the extenuating circumstance forms. The ECH was creating using HTML5, jQuery and PHP, this allows it be accessed all over the campus where an internet connection is available.</p>
<p>This project was a steep learning curve, from writing and running simple examples of code to actually creating a system that in the end was chosen to be used on a daily basis at Truro College.</p>
