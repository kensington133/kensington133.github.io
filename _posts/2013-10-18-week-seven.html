<p>This week I finished off one of shoreline's <a title="Shoreline Extreme Sports interactive payments form" href="http://www.shorelineactivities.co.uk/shoreline.activity.payments" target="_blank">interactive payment form</a> for extreme sports activites.</p>
<p>This form uses PHP to process the data and sends it to a special paypal page. jQuery was used to validate the form to make sure erroneous input was avoided.</p>
<p>My next task was to fix a bug in the MD Web solutions client admin system. The bug was that any users on a mac computer weren't able to use the custom image uploader fort the portfolio links part of the admin system. To fix this I adapted a form from another part of the admin system in order to allow ful cross browser and operating system compatibility.</p>
<p>Finally my final task of the week was to edit an image using photoshop to create a gradient around the main background image for <a title="Alchemist Jewellery in Bude, Cornwall" href="http://www.alchemist-jewellery.com/" target="_blank">Alchemist Jewellery</a>. To do this was a method of trial and error in order for the image to look just right.</p>
