This project utilises the [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) web application frame work, this was my first ember project with out following a guide. After having a look over what I had done previously, I decided to use the [hacker news api](http://api.ihackernews.com/) to create a responsive page that retrieves the front page news, how many comments there is and a link to the article destination page.
