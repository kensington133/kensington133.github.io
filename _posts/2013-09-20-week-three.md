This week I have continued to add more pages and content with SEO when they were emailed to me. also I was working on the BudeZest website, adding in the homepage content, cropping the images for it and making it look like the design.

I had a few problems try to align certain elements such as the arrows for the accordion in Internet Explorer as it handles everything differently compare to modern browsers.

At the end of the week finished off Shoreline by updating images to reflect their activities and changing the overlay colours to match the page colours, changing the tell us form to be more free form instead of specific tick boxes.
