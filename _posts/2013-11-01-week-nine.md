I started off this week by doing some updates for the Beach at Bude, a luxury hotel in Cornwall. Firstly I had to move the main content div to accommodate for the new menu width, this was a simple task as it was only finding the right amount by changing a CSS rule. Finally I had to add some content to the [wedding prices page](http://www.thebeachatbude.co.uk/luxury.functions.cornwall "Weddings at the Beach in Bude, Cornwall"), this included adding a table with various pricing information and some additional text.

Also on BudeZest I received some feedback from the client and was told to change the layout of the page in order to be more interesting and to fit the amount of content correctly.

Next, I worked on the Olive Tree website, adapting the calendar to work with some new calendar fetching code to work with this website. This allowed me to work with the JavaScript Ajax method which allows for fetching of scripts and pages without reloading the page. This allowed for the calendar data to be fetched month by month instead of all the data since it was first implemented.

Finally I applied some small changes to AJ paving, I removed some text from the images as the client didn't like the text being over the image. I Also changed the email to the correct preferred one.
