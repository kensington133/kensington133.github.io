<p>I started of this week by starting on the latest <a title="Shoreline Extreme Sports, Event sign up interactive form" href="http://md-startupwebsites.co.uk/shoreline/shoreline.event.payments" target="_blank">interactive form</a> for Shoreline Extreme Sports. The form allows users to sign up for sporting events such as Triathlons and Quadrathlons.</p>
<p>To create this form I used HTML for the form structure, PHP to handle to data and to send an email with the information to the administrators of the site to confirm it with the paypal confirmation email and jQuery for the form validation and to hide and show the relevant fields depending on which event you have selected from a drop down list.</p>
<p>My next task of the week was to update some content on the Beach at Bude's <a title="Beach at Bude wellness page" href="http://www.thebeachatbude.co.uk/spa.treatments.bude" target="_blank">wellness page</a>, Also on this website I had to add some pictures to the full screen slideshow that is the main background for the website. This meant I had to crop images to an acceptable size so that they weren't so large that the took a long time to load, but not so small as to loose their quality.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">One of the more interesting tasks of this week was to create a <a title="Guitar Retreats, gift voucher page" href="http://www.guitar-retreats.co.uk/guitar.retreats.gift.vouchers" target="_blank">gift voucher purchasing page</a> on the Guitar Retreats website. I drew on my previous knowledge of doing similar paypal forms on shorelines website which allowed my to create the form with little help or errors. To create the form I used HTML for the basic elements, PHP to handle to data for the email to check against the paypal confirmation email and jQuery to perform the form validation to avoid erroneous input.</span></p>
