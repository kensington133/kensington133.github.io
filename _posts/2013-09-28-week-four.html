<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">I started off the weekÂ </span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">doing some minor updates to the Beach at Bude website, I was given a photoshop file and then changed the prices page to be in a table to match the photoshop file.</span></p>
<p>Then for the rest of the week i was creating an interactive slideshow for Elements Hotel in Widemouth Bay using javascript and jQuery.</p>
<p>I created roughly about 70% of the slideshow then became stuck and asked for help and ended up finishing it off with extra help.</p>
<p>The next day it was suggested that I should write the slideshow again from scratch in order to make sure i had learnt how to do it properly. although this was frustrating at first by the end of the week when i had completed the slideshow I had learnt a lot more and reinforced my jQuery and javascript knowledge than if i just used the version that I created at the start of the week</p>
<p>It will be put live next week and a link to it will be featured at the top of every page in the website</p>
