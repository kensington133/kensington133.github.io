<p>This week I modified my website crawler, I changed my file<br />
full of function into a class with private and public functions.<br />
This required me to change lines of code where I had previously had<br />
just <code>function()</code> to<br />
<code>$class->function()</code>. After a brief check<br />
it was all up and running and working again. I also created a<br />
google analytics check, this checks the homepage of the website to<br />
see if the google analytics JavaScript had been added to the page.<br />
This was a lot easier than I had imagined as all the code snippets<br />
have the string <code>GoogleAnalyticsObject</code> this<br />
allowed me to simple Los the page content in with cURL and search<br />
the content for the google analytics string. Also this week I<br />
decided to update my website using <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> a<br />
responsive CSS framework and <a href="http://en-gb.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> a blogging<br />
platform. This allowed me to create a mobile friendly, tablet<br />
friendly and desktop friendly website without the use of sub<br />
domains and redirects. Using and customising foundation for my<br />
home, contact and links pages was a great learning opportunity as<br />
well as installing and modifying various aspects of<br />
Wordpress.</p>
