This week I have been working on Shoreline Extreme Sports,

Shoreline offer extreme sporting activities such as surfing and kayaking and they have employed MD to update their dated website.

I have been adding in content from an email, creating pages for the content if it doesn't exist.

I have also been implementing search engine optimisation in order for the website to be found as fast as possible in Google.

I have learnt how to use PhotoShop automation which allowed me to crop a batch of images all in one go.
