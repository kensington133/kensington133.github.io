<p>This week I finished the quote form for <a href="http://geckoheadgear.com/contact/quote">Gecko Head Gear</a>. I was given a few amendments to prices and getting the quantity prices to change correctly for the optional extras. I should hopefully go live next week.</p>
<p>Also nearer the end of the week I was given images to crop and upload images to the Alchemist Jewellery website. This should hopefully go live next week also.</p>
