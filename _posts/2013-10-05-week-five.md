Unfortunately this week I was ill for the majority of the week.

However on Monday I did some text updates to various sites and on Tuesday I started to work on the Bed and Breakfast demo website, I was tasked with improving how all of the data was being fetched from the database and needed to make a function that only got data from a specified amount of days. I only started this so will probably be continuing this during this week.
