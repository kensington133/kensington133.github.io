<p>This week I have been working on Shoreline Extreme Sports,</p>
<p>Shoreline offer extreme sporting activities such as surfing and kayaking and they have employed MD to update their dated website.</p>
<p>I have been adding in content from an email, creating pages for the content if it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>I have also been implementing search engine optimisation in order for the website to be found as fast as possible in google</p>
<p>I have learnt how to use PhotoShop automation which allowed me to crop a batch of images all in one go.</p>
