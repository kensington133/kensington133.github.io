Unfortunately I had to completely re-do the lookout [mobile website](http://m.thelookoutincornwall.co.uk/) this week, the decision was made due to the font 'Loved by the King' was for some reason not working with foundation. I tried test pages without any foundation scripts or styles installed and the font [worked fine](http://m.thelookoutincornwall.co.uk/FOUNDATION-MOBILESITE-BACKUP/test.php) and it worked fine, so I had to go over the site and change it to use MD Web Solutions mobile template which resolved the font issues.

I have no idea why this was happening in foundation, as I didn't create it it would of taken far longer to find the bug so instead the mobile website was re-done.

However due to the lack of foundation I had the opportunity to create a new testimonial slider from scratch which helped improve my jQuery skills and knowledge about animating opacity and z-index CSS values.
