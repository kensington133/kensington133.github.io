<p>As there wasn't that much on this week, I was spending my time on personal development.</p>
<p>During this week I have started to learn <a title="Ember JS - MVC applications" href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">ember.js</a> a JavaScript framework for creating web applications. I had been contemplating learning ember for a little while, during this quiet week was the perfect time to get stuck in.</p>
<p>To begin with a followed a tutorial, this took me through the basics of ember with its routes, controllers and templates. All of these concepts were new to me and took some getting used to, but by the end of the week I was well on the way to making my own application.</p>
<p>After completing the ToDo MVC <a title="Ember JS ToDo Guide" href="http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/" target="_blank">tutorial</a> I ended up with <a title="Ember JS completed ToDo tutorial" href="http://heybenshort.co.uk/ember-js/todo/" target="_blank">this</a>. I feel that doing this tutorial was the right start into understanding ember fully.</p>
<p>Once I had completed the ToDo tutorial I thought I should adapt this into a similar app to really get to learn ember, you can only learn so much by following guides. In my next app I changed some of the CSS, and played around with some logic and ended up with <a title="Ember JS - Basic guest manager app" href="http://heybenshort.co.uk/ember-js/party-guests/" target="_blank">guest organiser</a>.</p>
