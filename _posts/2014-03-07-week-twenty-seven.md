This week I added more content to the brendon arms [mobile website](http://brendonarms.co.uk/).

Also this week I created a graphic for the castle rise dental practice [website](http://castlerisedentalpractice.co.uk/). The graphic advertises the online appointment booking system, this graphic replaced the 'coming soon' graphic I created back in December.

Previously the olive tree had a gallery page on their [website](http://olivetreebude.co.uk/gallery), so all I had to do was add the page back into the allowed pages file and it was up and running again.
