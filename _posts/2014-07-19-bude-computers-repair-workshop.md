This was an interesting project for [Bude Computers](http://www.budecomputers.co.uk/), A computer sales and repair shop in Bude, Cornwall. Bude Computers wanted a system to store and keep track of repairs that are being undertaken instead of writing down information in notepad.

First off was the design, for simplicity and the fact that only a few people will see/use the system I decided to use the [Foundation Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/). This allows the system to be fully responsive so that it can be accessed on any device from anywhere. I decided not to modify the frameworks default styling as this was unnecessary for this particular clients needs.

I was given various designs on pieces of paper to work off and ended up with what you can see in the gallery below.

This was great experience using foundation and dealing with clients first hand.
