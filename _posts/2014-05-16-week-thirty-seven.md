This week I started to create the [demo catalogue system](http://catalogue.md-softwaresystems.co.uk/) to test my new postage class.

To create the demo website I used [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) a responsive framework which will allow me create a website that will work on most devices. I chose to use foundation as it allows for the fast creation of responsive pages.

To start of with I had create a basic homepage with place holder images for products that I created a bit later on, after using [placekitten](http://placekitten.com/) for my placeholder images I decided to do a pet shop website. Now that I had decided what to put in my shop I went about using MD Web Solutions admin system to add products and assign postage to them using my new postage class.

Now that I have the data I went about using MD's API to fetch all the product data to create the [category](http://catalogue.md-softwaresystems.co.uk/shop/) and [product](http://catalogue.md-softwaresystems.co.uk/product/Tortoise+Shell/1205) pages using the data pulled back from the database.

Next week I plan on creating basket where users can go through the purchasing process and end up at a PayPal page by creating a custom PayPal form.
