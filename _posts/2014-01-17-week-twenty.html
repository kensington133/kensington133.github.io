This week I was working on Gecko Headgears quote section of the website. The client came in and was interested in changing the way the form works. At the time you had to specify if you wanted every option, even the optional extras before you could submit the quote. The client wanted the form separated into two sections, one for the helmets and the other for the optional extras.

As this website was quite an old one it was a challenge to understand what was going on to begin with, but I decided it would be better for me in the long run to start from scratch with the JavaScript and HTML as it is quite a complex system.

I started by getting all the HTML in order and sorted before I attempted the JavaScript for the page. I created a backup of the existing page and copied some of the elements from there in order to get the correct id's for the elements.

Once the HTML was complete I started by commenting out all the JavaScript that handled the quote page in order to not get confused with any classes or ID's I may have changed. In the end I ended up re-factoring the JavaScript by at least 100 lines of code, this ranged from completely changing how the next input is faded in to how to the duplicate filters for different helmet styles.
